# For recruiters!
To ease your job here is a tier list of my repositories. I have about 25 repos but only 1/3 is public, so if you want to see my newest project go here: https://boardmeister.com 
(it's also private, so you can only check it from normal user point of view).

Also, it seems that commits to private repos won't show on `Contribution activity` and it looks like I'm not doing anything :/. But I assure you there is at least one/two commits per day.

## Tier 1 - My proudest work
1. [Dito](https://github.com/Mortimer333/Dito)
2. [IdemDito](https://github.com/Mortimer333/IdemDito) - App skeleton made with Dito
3. [Dullahan]([https://github.com/Mortimer333/tetraquark](https://github.com/Mortimer333/Dullahan))
4. [Dullahan Project]([https://github.com/Mortimer333/Content](https://github.com/Mortimer333/dullahan-project))

## Tier 2 - Cool but nothing amazing

1. [tetraquark](https://github.com/Mortimer333/tetraquark)
2. [Content](https://github.com/Mortimer333/Content)
3. [Symfony Blueprint for freelance or hobby projects](https://github.com/Mortimer333/php_blueprint)
4. [Xeno](https://github.com/Mortimer333/Xeno)
5. [Tab_JF](https://github.com/Mortimer333/Tab_JF)
6. [Validate](https://github.com/Mortimer333/Validate) - cool feature of dynamic rules change for validation

## Tier 3 - Would delete, but it's good to have old repos to show growth :/
Anything else you find there.
